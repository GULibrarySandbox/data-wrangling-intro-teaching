# data-wrangling-intro

A Griffith University Library-developed lesson on data wrangling with OpenRefine for Humanities and Social Sciences.

It covers the use of [OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org) open source software for cleaning up datasets that contain messy, missing or inconsistent data.

This lesson has been freely adapted from the [Library Carpentry lesson on OpenRefine](https://librarycarpentry.org/lc-open-refine/) and has been informed by learner feedback.

This is a step-by-step teaching script for those who would like to be able to offer this lesson to learners.
